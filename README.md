# Rhme-2016

The second round is coming!

The RHme2 (Riscure Hack me 2) is our low level hardware CTF challenge that comes in the form of an Arduino Nano board. The new edition provides a completely different set of new challenges to test your skills in side channel, fault injection, cryptoanalysis and software exploitation attacks.

The CTF will officially start during BlackHat Europe 2016! Pre-register for the challenge by finding the secret flag stored in this binary and mail it to us at rhme2@riscure.com. We will send you the RHme2 board for free, a few weeks before the BlackHat Europe.
