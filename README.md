# Rhme-2016

The second round is coming!

The RHme2 (Riscure Hack me 2) is our low level hardware CTF challenge that comes in the form of an Arduino Nano board. The new edition provides a completely different set of new challenges to test your skills in side channel, fault injection, cryptoanalysis and software exploitation attacks.
